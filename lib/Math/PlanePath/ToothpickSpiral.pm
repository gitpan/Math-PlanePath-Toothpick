=head1 NAME

Math::PlanePath::ToothpickSpiral -- integer points in stair-step diagonal stripes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::PlanePath::ToothpickSpiral;
 my $path = Math::PlanePath::ToothpickSpiral->new;
 my ($x, $y) = $path->n_to_xy (123);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This path is length=2 toothpicks placed in an anti-clockwise spiral.
A single new toothpick is added at an end of the preceding.  Each is as
close to the origin as possible without toothpicks overlapping.  Ends may
touch, but no overlapping.

         |   |   |
         5---4-- 1  ...

      ---6---7 -10--11
             |   |   |
           --8---9
                 |

The result is a stair-step diamond spiral starting vertically.  As per the
other toothpick paths the vertical toothpicks are "even" points X=Ymod2 and
horizontal toothpicks "odd" points X!=Ymod2.

X<Hexagonal numbers>N=1,15,45,etc on the X=Y leading diagonal and
N=6,28,66,etc on the X=Y-1 South-West diagonal are the hexagonal numbers
k*(2k-1).  The odd hexagonals are to the North-East and the even hexagonals
to the South-West.

The hexagonal numbers of the "second kind" which are k*(2k-1) for k
negative.  They fall similarly on the X=-Y-1 North-West and X=-Y South-East
diagonals.

=head2 N Start

The default is to number points starting N=1 as shown above.  An optional
C<n_start> can give a different numbering of the same shape.  For example to
start at 0,
